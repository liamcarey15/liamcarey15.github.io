so far I have liked it and I have enjoyed Umaine so far. My major here is Business Marketing and Im excited to see where that takes me. Also Im an avid sports fan My favorite team is the New England Patriots.
I am a big fan of every Boston sports team. What I am most looking forward to at Maine is probably the hockey games. I have enjoyed Maine so far I really enjoy this gorgeous state and the people.
I look forward to this new chapter in my life and what it beholds.
